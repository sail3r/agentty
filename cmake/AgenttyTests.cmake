# AgenttyTests.cmake — the declarative test table.

# One agentty_test() per test. MODE consolidated folds into the agentty_tests
# doctest binary; standalone builds its own exe (forkers/PTY/fuzzers/benches);
# raw = caller-defined (narrow-source sanitizer tests). Aggregates (`tests`,
# `tests_gating`, `sanitizer_tests`) are DERIVED at finalize — no hand-listing.
#
# Requires (set by the root before include): AGENTTY_SHARED_OBJECTS,
# AGENTTY_HAS_RAGCPP, AGENTTY_HAS_MIMALLOC, AGENTTY_MCP, and the imported
# targets (maya::maya, mcp::*, acp::acp, doctest::doctest, OpenSSL, …).

# sandbox_live_check: does the sandbox actually ENFORCE, on this host, right

# of the code. In CI it would either skip itself (proving nothing, greenly) or

# ARGV/plan we build (no namespaces needed), and claybin's own 20-test suite
# covers the engine. This closes the last gap between "the plan says X" and
# "the child experiences X" -- which is exactly where the mremap bug lived:
# every table-level test passed while realloc() failed in the guest.
# Compiles the two backend sources straight in rather than linking
# agentty_tool_obj: that objlib drags the whole tool layer (mcp config,
# auth, teardown) behind it, and this check only needs the spawn paths.
# sandbox.cpp comes along for build_bwrap_argv -- the bwrap masking case
# drives the REAL argv rather than a hand-built one, so it cannot drift from

# lag (0.15), profiled it, and retired it because a short buffer leaves the
# cursor idle AT the edge between bursts -- a sprint, then a stall, which is
# what "slow and bursty" means.
#
# Measured on this fixture, sweeping the lag window with production's own

# (max per-frame jump 14), 0.40 on 2.9% (11), 0.55 on 1.6% (9), 0.70 on 0.9%

# retune cannot quietly reintroduce the chunking.

# this was added: 4 entries named files that no longer existed and 28 granted
# primitives the file had stopped using -- including provider/ollama/provider.cpp,
# renamed to transport.cpp long enough ago that the successor uses neither of
# the two primitives its entry still allowed.

# Cost is a file read, no compile. Narrowing a grant is the cheap half of
# keeping the banlist honest.

#
# Those two files are the only thing standing between us and a repeat of the

# sends as an object and every model silently fell through to guessing from
# its filename. The stub is where we write down what we believe each local
# server returns; CLAIMS is where we write down what to go check against a
# real one.
#
# They drifted, in the direction that hides: the stub's lmstudio mode had no
# capability object at all, so the reader that commit added never executed in
# any test, and CLAIMS never mentioned the field either. Nothing failed. The
# feature simply had no coverage and looked like it did.
#
# This asks the weaker of the two questions -- does the stub serve what we
# claim -- because it is the half that needs no hardware. It cannot tell you
# the claim matches reality; only pointing the script at a real llama.cpp or
# LM Studio does that. What it does buy: adding a shape to the stub without
# stating the claim (or vice versa) now fails here instead of years later.
