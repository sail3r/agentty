agentty speaks the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) both ways: it can **serve** its native tools to any MCP client, and **consume** tools from other MCP servers inside a thread.

Just want to add a tool (a browser driver, a database client)? See **[Plugins](/docs/plugins)** for the practical `mcp.json` / `agentty plugin add` guide. This page is the full protocol reference.

## Serving agentty's tools (mcp-serve)

`agentty mcp-serve` runs headless — no terminal UI — and exposes agentty's native toolset over MCP on stdio. An external MCP client (Claude Desktop, an IDE, another agent) drives `tools/list` and `tools/call` over stdin/stdout; diagnostics go to stderr.

```bash
agentty mcp-serve
```

The served tools are the same native tools the TUI uses: file `read`/`write`/`edit`/`move`/`remove`, shell `bash`, long-running `process_*` sessions, focused `test`, code search (`grep`/`glob`/`find_definition`/`search_structural`/`repo_map`), web fetch/search, diagnostics, and the `git_*` family including `git_show` and `git_blame`. Filesystem tools stay sandboxed to the workspace boundary and shell/process calls run inside the OS sandbox, exactly as they do interactively.

`mcp-serve` is deliberately **native-only**. A configured external MCP server is never re-exported implicitly, preventing credential leaks and recursive MCP proxy loops.

agentty's own settings decide what it serves: a native tool switched off for agentty's model is not offered to MCP clients either. Today that is `web_search` when `Ctrl+K → Settings → Web Search` (or `AGENTTY_WEB_SEARCH`) is `off`. The setting is read when `mcp-serve` starts; restart it after changing it.

## Point a client at it

Any MCP client can launch agentty as a stdio server. For a client that reads a JSON config (Claude Desktop shown here):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentty": {
      "command": "agentty",
      "args": ["mcp-serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Consuming other MCP servers

The reverse of serving is **consuming** — agentty adds tools to a thread by connecting to external MCP servers listed in an `mcp.json`, which is exactly what a **[plugin](/docs/plugins)** is. See that page for the practical how-to (`agentty plugin add`, the Plugins picker, project vs user scope, and the [trust gate](/docs/plugin-trust) on repo-shipped servers). The rest of this section is the protocol-level behaviour:

- **Provenance naming.** External tools get stable, namespaced names such as `mcp__playwright__browser_click`; they can never collide with or impersonate native tools.
- **Live catalog.** `tools/list_changed` is honoured live, including removals and schema replacements.
- **Tool budget / brokering.** To keep provider requests fast and tool choice accurate, agentty sends all native and pinned tools plus at most 16 MCP tools ranked for the current request. The always-available `mcp_search_tools` and `mcp_call` broker exposes the long tail without injecting hundreds of schemas into every turn.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Per-server policy is explicit:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp"],
      "timeoutMs": 30000,
      "connectTimeoutMs": 10000,
      "maxOutputChars": 30000,
      "trustAnnotations": false,
      "tools": {
        "include": ["browser_click", "browser_snapshot", "browser_navigate"],
        "exclude": ["browser_install"],
        "pin": ["browser_snapshot"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `disabled:true` keeps a configured server off without deleting it.
- `trustAnnotations` defaults to `false`: remote read-only hints cannot silently weaken permission checks. Enable it only for a server you trust.
- `include`/`exclude` filter the advertised surface; `pin` keeps important tools in every turn.
- Stdio and HTTP servers receive the workspace through MCP roots.
- Calls stream MCP progress into the live tool card, propagate Esc cancellation, and reconnect a poisoned/crashed server on its next call.
- Independent servers execute concurrently; each individual transport retains its own serialization.

:::note
MCP consumption is lazy and opt-in — with no `.agentty/mcp.json` present, startup is a single `stat()` that returns nothing, so there is zero overhead when you aren't using it.

## Authorizing an OAuth-gated server

Some hosted MCP servers require OAuth (MCP spec **2026-07-28** authorization). When you run agentty against one, an unauthorized call returns an actionable error instead of hanging. Authorize once with:

```bash
agentty mcp-login <server>
```

This runs the full OAuth 2.1 + PKCE flow: agentty discovers the authorization server from the endpoint's protected-resource metadata (RFC 9728), dynamically registers itself (`application_type=native`, so the loopback redirect is accepted), opens your browser to authorize, catches the redirect on a local loopback port, and validates the response — including the **RFC 9207 `iss` check** that blocks authorization-server mix-up attacks *before* the code is exchanged.

### When the server doesn't support Dynamic Client Registration

Some authorization servers don't offer a registration endpoint. Give agentty a `client_id` instead — an `https://` value is used as a **CIMD** (Client ID Metadata Document) URL, the 2026-07-28 preferred path where the URL *is* the client identity; anything else is treated as a pre-registered public client. In precedence order:

```bash
agentty mcp-login acme --client-id https://agentty.example/client.json   # CIMD URL
agentty mcp-login acme --client-id my-registered-client-id               # pre-registered id
```

…or set it per-server in `mcp.json` (`"client_id"`) or globally via `AGENTTY_MCP_CLIENT_ID`:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "acme": { "url": "https://mcp.acme.dev/mcp",
    "client_id": "https://agentty.example/client.json" } } }
```

If the discovery probe can't find the metadata URL from the 401 challenge, pass it explicitly with `--metadata <url>`.

The resulting token is **issuer-bound** (it will never be replayed to a different authorization server), stored encrypted at rest (`~/.agentty/mcp_tokens/<server>.json`, `chmod 600`), attached automatically to every request to that server, and **refreshed transparently** when it expires. Manage tokens with:

```bash
agentty mcp-status          # list servers and which are authorized
agentty mcp-logout <server> # forget a stored token
```

A statically-configured `Authorization` header in `mcp.json` still wins, so you can also just paste a bearer token if you have one:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "acme": { "url": "https://mcp.acme.dev/mcp",
    "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer sk-..." } } } }
```

## External ACP agents

When an external ACP agent is selected, trusted servers from the same MCP configuration are passed through `session/new.mcpServers`. The delegated agent owns those calls and agentty renders their ACP tool updates as observed activity; it does not execute them a second time. Workspace-local MCP servers are passed through only once trusted — per-server [content-hash approval](/docs/plugin-trust) or the blanket `AGENTTY_MCP_ALLOW_PROJECT=1`.

Agentty does not silently inject a nested unrestricted `agentty mcp-serve` into delegated agents. That would duplicate built-ins, bypass clear execution ownership, and make recursive `task` flows possible.

## Searching an MCP server's resources

Beyond tools, an MCP server can expose **resources** (`resources/*`) — documents, wiki pages, reference material. agentty can fold those into its [retrieval engine](/docs/retrieval) so `search_docs` searches them alongside your local docs, skills, and memory, all fused into one ranked, source-tagged result set. It's off by default; enable with `AGENTTY_RAG_MCP=1` (requires an MCP config to be present). From the model's view a docs folder and an MCP server are the same thing — a knowledge source behind one interface.
