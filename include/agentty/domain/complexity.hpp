// agentty::smart — turn-complexity classification for Smart-Mode effort scaling.
//
// The research-backed lever (Anthropic, "Building a multi-agent research
// system": *scale effort to query complexity*; RouteLLM / cascade survey:
// upfront intent/complexity routing, *route conservatively for ambiguous
// queries*). A tiny local classifier hits ~90% accuracy for well-defined
// tiers at ~0 latency — no model call, no network. We classify the user's
// message into four tiers and let the orchestrator scale the Strategic
// model's reasoning effort accordingly (and drive the delegation budget the
// system prompt advertises).
//
// Conservative by design: DEFAULT is Standard, and a strong complexity signal
// escalates while only a clearly-trivial message de-escalates. Over-routing to
// "think harder" is far cheaper than under-thinking a hard turn, so ties break
// upward.

// This is a small ADDITIVE FEATURE SCORE, not a keyword lookup: three
// orthogonal, mostly language-agnostic signal families each contribute weight,
// and the sum is thresholded into a tier. That fixes the old all-or-nothing
// behaviour (one stray "design" forcing Complex) and generalises past a fixed
// English lexicon:
//   • STRUCTURAL (language-agnostic): enumerated asks, conjunction/clause
//     density, code-token density, question shape, glyph length. A request's
//     complexity lives mostly in its STRUCTURE, not its verbs.
//   • LEXICAL (multilingual): weighted "hard"/"trivial" keyword sets across the
//     major languages — evidence that ADDS weight, never a hard override.
//   • MORPHOLOGICAL: token-shape variety (prose vs. identifiers vs. paths).
// Conservative: ties break upward (under-thinking a hard turn costs more than
// over-thinking a cheap one).
