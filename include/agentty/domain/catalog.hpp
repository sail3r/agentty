// what the context-window cap is) all depend on what model the user
// picked. The provider doesn't expose a capability probe — `/v1/models`
// returns ids and display metadata, not "this model accepts the
// fine-grained-streaming beta" — so we infer the capabilities from the
// model id string. Centralised here so every site that asks "is this
// Sonnet 4?" reads from the same decoded value, and adding support for
// a new generation ("claude-haiku-5-…") only touches `decode()` rather
// than every if-substring check across the runtime.
//
// Decoding strategy: tokenise on '-' rather than substring matching.
// Anthropic ids follow `claude-{family}-{generation}-{revision}[-{date}]`,
// so a positional tokeniser stays robust as the catalog grows. The old
// `model.find("opus-4")` / `model.find("haiku-4")` scheme silently
// stopped recognising the generation the moment a `-5-` model shipped;
// with tokens we read the integer after `family` and the >= 4 check
// keeps working without source edits.
//
// Limitation: this is still inference, not a contract from upstream. If

// shared across a whole turn — reasoning prose AND the tool-call JSON come out
// of the same budget. An `edit` is the worst case: the model reproduces the
// existing `old_text` VERBATIM (for the fuzzy match) plus the `new_text`, so a
// single edit can be ~2x the tokens of a `write` over the same span. When the
// reasoning + the edit JSON together overrun 16384, the provider stops the
// stream mid-`input_json` with stop_reason=max_tokens and the args arrive
// truncated — surfacing as "Tool call arguments look incomplete". Subagents
// already dodge this (task.cpp hard-codes 32000); the main turn never did.
//
// ROBUSTNESS: we set the ceiling HIGH, matching what shipping agents do rather
// than guessing conservatively — a too-low cap silently truncates edits, which
// is the failure we're fixing. References (verified against real source):
//   • Claude Code  default 32000 for Sonnet/Opus, raisable via
//                  CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS; Opus 4.6 → 64k–128k.

// (Anthropic 400s a max_tokens above the model ceiling).
