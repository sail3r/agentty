// agentty::smart — role-based execution routing (Smart Mode foundation).
//
// See docs/design/smart-mode.md. The idea: a turn (or an internal call) has a
// ROLE — Strategic (plan / hard reasoning), Implementation (write code /
// mechanical edits), Utility (grep / read / commit-msg / retrieval) — and the
// role resolves to a (model, effort) PROFILE at dispatch time, instead of
// hard-coding a model name at each call site.
//
// This header is the PURE resolver (Step 1). It has no I/O, no runtime deps,
// no wire — just the mapping `role -> RoleProfile` given the parent model, the
// user's effort, and the provider's model catalog. It reuses the existing
// catalog primitives (cheapest_capable_model, tier, model_picker_less,
// clamp_effort) so "which model is cheaper/stronger" stays in ONE place.
//
// Zero-config by design: with no user overrides, enabling Smart Mode routes
//   Strategic      -> the parent (flagship) model, at the user's effort
//   Implementation -> the strongest MID-tier model, at one effort step down
//   Utility        -> the cheapest capable model, effort OFF
// A single-model / Opus-only / one-tier account degrades to "everything on the
// parent model" — no change, no regression — exactly like the subagent router.

//      (no `minimal`) a step down from Low landed on Minimal, which
//      clamp_effort then snapped back UP to Low — so Implementation never
//      actually stepped down from a Low parent.

// ── The Smart Mode overlay's rows, as a TYPE ────────────────────────────
//
// A row is the master switch or one of the three role slots. That is the
// whole domain, so it is spelled as an enum rather than an int index into a
// list someone has to remember the shape of.
//
// The int was not a small stylistic matter. The overlay was cut from eleven
// rows to four; the renderer followed, and four other places did not. The
// cursor wrapped modulo 11 (so ↑/↓ walked through seven rows that are never
// drawn), two slot-assign returns re-opened at `8 + slot` (the old slot
// rows), and the clear-slot handler mapped every index ≥ 3 to Utility — so
// `x` on an out-of-range cursor silently reset a slot the user was not on.
// Every one of those was representable because the type said "any integer"
// while only four values were legal, and the layout was duplicated at each
// site instead of being stated once.
//
// With this enum: there is no eighth row to name, `next`/`prev` cannot leave
// the enumeration, and a slot row maps to a ModelRole by a total function
// with no arithmetic. The bug class is gone, not patched.

    Utility,         // ─┘
};

// and every conversion below is derived from it.
