// agentty::store_fx — persistence as effects, not as calls through a seam.
//
// A reducer used to reach the disk through `Deps`:
//
//     deps().save_thread(m.d.current);      // happens DURING the reducer
//
// which makes the reducer impure: to test that a turn is saved you have to
// install a fake store and inspect it afterwards, and the reducer can no
// longer be read as "state in, state + description-of-effects out".
//
// As effects the same thing is a VALUE the reducer returns:
//
//     return save_thread_fx(m.d.current);   // DESCRIBES a save
//
// The host carries it out (see runtime/app/host.hpp), and a test asserts on
// the returned Cmd — `expect_effect<save_thread>(1)` — with no store at all.
// That is the whole point of the jaal shape; see docs/design/jaal-rewrite.md.
//
// WHY THESE FOUR AND NOT THE WHOLE OF Deps. An effect is something with a
// side effect on the world: writing a thread, deleting one, writing a file,
// writing settings. `Deps` also carried `new_thread_id` and `title_from`,
// which are pure functions that never needed erasing — they're called
// directly now. And `load_*` are READS, which an effect can't express
// (jaal effects don't return values into the reducer); the ones that were
// really "read state the Model already holds" now read `m.d.persisted`, and
// the two genuine reads that remain are documented where they are.
