// agentty::Msg — every event the runtime can process, as a closed grouped variant.
//
// History:
//   v1: 79 leaf alternatives in one std::variant. sizeof(Msg) = max over all 79
//       leaves; one std::visit call instantiated a 79-arm dispatch table; one
//       update.cpp TU compiled all 79 arms in a single overload{}. Tolerable at
//       first; began to wobble with scale — compile time of update.cpp climbed
//       past 15 s, sizeof(Msg) was pinned by the heaviest alternative no matter
//       which path was active, and any leaf change forced a full recompile of
//       the dispatch site.
//
//   v2 (this file): leaves grouped into 10 domain sub-variants. The top-level
//       Msg is a `std::variant` of those domains. The flat construction syntax
//       still works:
//
//           Msg m1 = ComposerEnter{};       // -> Msg{ComposerMsg{ComposerEnter{}}}
//           dispatch(StreamTextDelta{"x"}); // -> dispatch(Msg{StreamMsg{...}})
//
//       std::variant's converting constructor walks each alternative; only the
//       matching domain accepts a given leaf, so the wrap is unambiguous and
//       implicit. Call sites don't change.
//
//       Per-domain reducers live in update/<domain>.cpp; update.cpp's top-level
//       std::visit is now a 10-arm dispatcher that forwards into them. Each
//       domain's TU compiles independently — touching a composer leaf no
//       longer forces stream/login/diff to recompile.
