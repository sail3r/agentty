// agentty::Cmd — the effect row, declared once.
//
// jaal puts a program's effects IN ITS TYPE (D2): `Cmd<Msg, a, b, c>` says
// which effects this program may return, and a host must handle every one
// of them or the program won't compile against it. That is the property
// that makes the ACP host tractable — the compiler lists what it still owes
// instead of us finding out at runtime.
//
// So the row lives here, in one place, and everything else says `Cmd`.
//
// Three groups:
//
//   jaal core     quit, send, after, task, now, random — always available,
//                 no need to name them (D6: the core row is always in).
//   maya terminal set_title, commit_scrollback, write_clipboard, suspend,
//                 ... — things only a TERMINAL can do. A non-terminal host
//                 (ACP) will not serve these, which is exactly why they are
//                 listed: the compiler will say so.
//   agentty's own save_settings, save_thread, ... — things only THIS app
//                 does. Added as the Deps seam is dismantled (step 7 in
//                 docs/design/jaal-rewrite.md).

// ── agentty's value types, as jaal sees them ──────────────────────────────
// jaal's Sendable walks a type's fields to prove a Msg is safe to hand to
// another thread (D7). Id<Tag> is a strong newtype around one std::string,
// but it has user-declared constructors, so it isn't an aggregate and jaal
// can't look inside — it refuses rather than guess:
//
//   it contains 'agentty::Id<agentty::ToolCallIdTag>', a class jaal can't
//   see inside; if it owns everything it holds, specialise
//   jaal::sendable_opt_in for it
//
// It does own everything it holds: one std::string, by value, no views and
// no pointers. So it is Sendable, and Frozen too — nothing reachable
// through a const Id can change.
//
// Declared HERE rather than in domain/id.hpp so the domain header stays
// free of jaal: the same rule maya follows (host/interop.hpp), and the same
// reason — a value type shouldn't know which runtime is carrying it.

// ImageContent owns its bytes (LazyBytes) and a shared base64 cell, and
// LazyBytes owns a content-addressed Source plus the bytes it resolves to.
// Moving either to another thread is safe: every lazily-filled slot is
// written exactly once under std::call_once and read through an acquire load
// after, so a thread either runs the fill or waits for it and then sees the
// finished bytes. (That discipline is not incidental — jaal's Sendable found
// a real race in LazyBytes on its first run against this code, 19 TSan
// reports to zero, and it is D7's worked example. The fix is what makes
// these opt-ins honest rather than silencers.)
//
// Sendable, NOT Frozen. Frozen means nothing reachable through a const T can
// change, and here the memoised bytes and the memoised base64 both can,
// behind const accessors. That is D8's distinction exactly — safe to MOVE to
// one other thread, not safe to SHARE between two — so these say Sendable
// only, and jaal::shared<ImageContent> stays correctly impossible.

// they cross to worker threads constantly.

// http::CancelToken is a shared mutable object, and Sendable refuses
// shared_ptr by default for exactly that reason. This is the case the rule
// is measured against rather than a hole in it: CancelToken is ONE
// std::atomic<bool> with a release store and an acquire load, and nothing
// else. Sharing it is the point — a reducer trips it (Esc in meta.cpp, a new
// turn in stream.cpp) while the tool worker polls it, and an atomic flag is
// how that conversation is supposed to happen.
//
// Not to be confused with the login flows, which used to carry their own
// shared_ptr<atomic_bool>. Those are gone: a login worker is a keyed
// Sub::stream now, so not asking for the subscription IS the cancel and
// there is no flag to pass (see cmd_factory's device_login_sub).
//
// The difference that made them different in the first place, and still
// makes THIS one an app concern: a stop_token is tripped by the RUNTIME
// when the work is no longer subscribed. A streaming turn is a Cmd::task,
// not a subscription, and the reducer needs to cancel that specific
// in-flight HTTP request from a later step. jaal has no effect for that,
// so the token stays the app's own.
//
// Opting in the pointer, not the token: the shared_ptr is what crosses.

// `kProviders`, an `inline constexpr std::array` in registry.hpp, so the
// target has static storage duration and outlives every thread. The type's
// own comment already made that promise ("static storage, never dangles");
// this is where jaal is told.
//
// The pointer is why Selection exists in this shape: identity and endpoint
// are orthogonal, and re-deriving identity from `openai_endpoint.label` broke
// custom hosts, because pointing a provider at a custom base URL overwrites
// the label. Carrying the row makes identity a value.
//
// Not Frozen — nothing needs it to be, and the endpoint strings are mutable
// through a non-const Selection.

// ── the message tree, as jaal routes it ───────────────────────────────
// Msg is a variant of 23 DOMAIN variants, not 231 leaves — agentty grouped
// them because a flat Msg pinned sizeof(Msg) to the heaviest leaf and cost
// ~19 s to rebuild after touching one. jaal's D36 is that shape, measured on
// this app: one domain TU rebuilds in 1.19 s, the loop TU went 6.9 s -> 1.77 s.
//
// jaal descends the tree on its own, so by default it wants an update() for
// every LEAF and says so, one diagnostic per missing case with the path it
// took (Msg -> AppearanceMsg -> AppearanceThemeCommit). We don't want that:
// each domain has ONE reducer that takes the whole domain variant and visits
// it itself, in its own TU. That is what handled_as_group declares.
//
// It opts in BY NAME rather than being inferred, and D36 explains why: a
// catch-all `template <class M> update(Model&, M)` matches a group type as
// happily as a leaf, so inferring it would let a catch-all silently claim
// every domain and switch off the exhaustiveness check underneath. Naming
// each one keeps the check on for every leaf we HAVEN'T grouped.
