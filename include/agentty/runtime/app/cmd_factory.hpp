//
// Which model serves this turn, at what effort, and why. ONE value, computed
// once by resolve_turn_routing() — the 🧠 card renders it and launch_stream
// dispatches it.
//
// The two used to derive it INDEPENDENTLY from the same Model, each running
// the same scan, the same classifier and the same effort scaler. The comment
// on both said "same call as launch_stream so card == wire", and keeping that
// true meant passing every argument identically at two sites forever. It did
// not stay true: a threshold added to the classifier reached one site and not
// the other, so the card advertised a route the request never took, and the
// only thing that noticed was a test written specifically to look for it.
//
// With one value there is nothing to keep in step. card == wire stops being an
// invariant under test and becomes an identity.

// (is_parallel_safe) with PATH analysis: two writers to disjoint files — or a
// read of a.c alongside a write of b.c — run in parallel instead of
// serialising. Conflicts (overlapping paths, any Exec, or a writer whose path
// can't be extracted) stay pending and advance on the next kick once the
// blocker settles. Submission order is preserved: a call never jumps ahead of
// an earlier conflicting call. `running` and `pending` index into the same
// logical batch; returns the subset of `pending` indices safe to start now.

// ── Doom-loop circuit breaker (pure; exposed for tests) ──────────────────────
// Weak local models (qwen2.5-coder, codellama, …) routinely fall into a
// non-converging tool loop: they pick the wrong tool for a goal (e.g. `read`
// on a URL or a file that doesn't exist), get an error result, and re-issue a
// near-identical call indefinitely. With no native completion signal the main
// agent loop would spin until the user hits Esc — the symptom behind the
// "tool usage is fucked" reports. Mirrors the iteration / repeated-failure
// caps every serious local-agent framework ships (Qwen-Agent, aider, cline).
//
// Given the full message history of the CURRENT agent turn (the run since the
// last real User message), returns a non-empty nudge string when the loop
// should be force-stopped, or std::nullopt to keep going. Two triggers:
//   (1) REPEAT: the same (tool, args) call appears >= kRepeatLimit times and
//       its results were failures — the model is stuck re-trying a dead call.
//       ALWAYS enforced (every production tool does this: aider's
//       max_reflections, MindStudio's "2–3 attempts then stop"). A capable
//       model that genuinely loops on a dead call benefits from it too.
//   (2) RUNAWAY: the run has made >= kMaxToolTurns assistant tool-call turns
//       without ever producing a plain-text answer — unbounded spend. Gated
//       behind `enforce_step_cap`. No production tool applies a hard
//       successful-step cap to a CAPABLE model by default: Claude Code's
//       max_turns is UNLIMITED by default, aider never step-caps. So the
//       caller passes enforce_step_cap=true ONLY for weak local models
//       (qwen2.5-coder/codellama) and false for Claude / capable hosted
//       models, which run until they finish on their own.
// The returned text is surfaced to the model as the final assistant turn so
// it can recover gracefully (and the user sees why the loop stopped).
