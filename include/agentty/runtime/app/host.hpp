// agentty::app::Host — maya's terminal host, plus agentty's own effects.
//
// maya::run() builds a terminal_host and hands it to jaal. That host knows
// every TERMINAL effect (scrollback, clipboard, suspend, …) and nothing
// else, which is correct: writing a thread to disk is not a thing a
// terminal does.
//
// So agentty wraps it. Everything maya's host handles is inherited; the
// four persistence effects get a handle() here. jaal's HostFor concept
// checks the union at compile time — an effect in agentty's Cmd row with
// no handler anywhere fails the build and NAMES itself, rather than
// silently never running.
//
// Why a wrapper and not a fork of maya::run: the terminal half is maya's
// business and should keep evolving there. This only adds the half maya
// can't know about.

    // That was not free. They used to take `host_context<terminal_host<P>>`
    // exactly, and jaal detects the hooks with
    // `requires { host.attach(cx); }` where cx is host_context<THIS host>.

    // "absent" rather than as an error. Fixed in maya; see the note there.
