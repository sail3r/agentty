// ── Saving settings ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE rule: `m.d.persisted` is the record. Saving is handing it over.
//
// agentty used to save settings two different ways, and they fought:
//
//   A. load-modify-save — `auto s = deps().load_settings(); s.x = ...;
//      deps().save_settings(s);` — which wrote the store but left
//      `m.d.persisted` stale.
//   B. persist_settings(m), which seeds FROM `m.d.persisted`.
//
// Every A-style write was therefore live ammunition pointed at the next B:
// toggle the changes strip (A), then change a theme or switch a model or
// quit (B), and B wrote its stale record straight over A's change. That is
// the "settings don't persist" bug — the write lands, then an unrelated
// save silently reverts it.
//
// The fix is to delete the A shape rather than to ask ~20 call sites to
// remember to also patch the record. Edit the field on `m.d.persisted`,
// then call this:
//
//     m.d.persisted.show_changes_strip = m.d.show_changes_strip;
//     save_record(m);
//
// so there is exactly one snapshot in play and nothing to keep in sync.
// Still write-behind at the seam, so a reducer never stalls a frame on disk.
//
// (This is the shape jaal wants the reducer to have. Once `update` returns
// `Cmd` instead of a pair, the body becomes
// `return Cmd::fx<save_settings>({m.d.persisted})` and the seam goes away
// entirely — see docs/design/jaal-rewrite.md. Routing every writer through
// one function now is what makes that a mechanical change later, instead of
// 20 separate ones.)

// can point past the end of a now-shorter filtered list. Closes outright
// when there is no parent (opened over the thread).
//
// ONE function because per-pane copies is how this drifted before: each
// close handler hardcoded a destination that was right for one entry
// point and wrong for the others. Navigation is a STACK, not a trapdoor —
// Esc walks back the way you came in.

// Install `cfg` everywhere Smart Mode is read. There are THREE holders, and

//
//   1. store::Settings   — persistence, so it survives restart
//   2. Model::Domain     — the UI thread; the classifier reads it per turn
//   3. tools::subagent   — a worker-thread copy, because `task` runs with no
//                          access to the Model at all
//
// That fan-out is what made this feature hard. It used to be open-coded at
// each call site, and every bug in the series was a site that did one or two
// of the three: saved but never applied (took effect only after restart),
// applied but never pushed to subagents (workers routed on stale policy).
// A caller cannot forget a step it does not perform.
//
// Persists as a side effect: "change the config" and "write it down" are the
// same intent, and splitting them is another pair of steps to get wrong.
// Returns the save so the caller can batch it — the write is an effect now,
// not something that happens inside the reducer.

// Feeds rehydrate_frozen's keep-loop, which walks newest-first summing
// these until it has covered a row budget. The estimate must never exceed
// the real rendered height: an over-count makes the loop believe it has
// covered the budget early and stop, keeping LESS history than intended,
// and for tools whose renderer elides output the gap can be arbitrarily
// large (a 500-line diff drawn as 7 rows). Under-counting is safe.
//
// Exported solely so tests can pin that estimate-vs-render contract per
// tool; nothing outside frozen.cpp calls it in production.
