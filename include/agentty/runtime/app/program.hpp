        //       subscription wakes the loop. On DEC-2026 terminals that's

        //       terminals WITHOUT mode 2026 (Apple Terminal, plain xterm,
        //       tmux without sync passthrough) every multi-row repaint
        //       paints progressively, so the chrome at the bottom of the
        //       frame (spinner / sparkline / status bar) visibly tears on
        //       each render. There the Tick already drops to 100 ms
        //       (subscribe.cpp), but this bucket must MATCH it: a 33 ms
        //       bucket against a 100 ms tick advances ~3x per wake, so the
        //       skip-render gate fires a torn repaint on every tick anyway
        //       and the 100 ms throttle buys nothing. Locking the bucket
        //       to the tick period means exactly one render per tick —
        //       ~10 fps of torn frames instead of ~10 redundant ones, and
        //       phase-locked so renders don't double up. The spinner is
        //       already capped at 10 fps by the tick on those terminals,
        //       so perceived smoothness is unchanged; we only stop the
        //       extra tearing repaints. On sync terminals the period is
        //       still 33 ms — UX identical to before.
        //   (b) idle with the composer caret blinking: lock to the blink
        //       HALF-period (265 ms = 530 ms / 2) so every hash step is
        //       exactly one caret toggle. This keeps the frame-request
        //       loop self-sustaining (each render re-issues the
        //       composer's frame request) and the blink perfectly
        //       regular, at ~4 renders/sec.
        //   (c) nothing animating at all (no caret — e.g. a modal owns
        //       focus): no time bucket, so a settled screen does ZERO
        //       idle renders until an event arrives.
