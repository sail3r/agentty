// agentty::ui::panel — the EXCLUSIVE panel slot, as a sum type.
//
// Model::UI used to carry 16 independent panel fields (pick::OneAxis
// here, an ad-hoc Closed|Open variant there). "Only one overlay open at
// a time" was a CONVENTION enforced by ~17 scattered
// `m.ui.X = pick::Closed{}` writes inside every Open* reducer — forget
// one and two overlays were open at once, with the router (overlay.hpp)
// papering over the ambiguity at dispatch time.
//
// Now every exclusive panel lives in ONE slot:
//
//     m.ui.panel.descend(pn::Models{{.index = 3}});  // open OVER (Esc unwinds)
//     m.ui.panel.replace(pn::Providers{{2}});         // hop SIDEWAYS (keep parent)
//     m.ui.panel.is<pn::Models>()                     // open?
//     m.ui.panel.get<pn::Models>()                    // payload* or nullptr
//     m.ui.panel.close<pn::Models>()                  // close IF topmost
//
// One slot, one variant — so "two exclusive panels open" is not a bug we
// guard against anymore, it is UNREPRESENTABLE. All the rival-closing
// writes are deleted, not relocated.
//
// What a variant does NOT give you is the parent chain, and that is where
// every navigation bug has lived. Assignment used to be the way to open,
// and it discarded the chain silently — so Esc from a panel opened out of
// another panel left the stack entirely. Assignment is now DELETED; see
// the three moves (descend / replace / restore) on State below, which is
// the single place that story is told.
//
// Deliberate NON-members (the exceptions that shape the design):
//   • login      — a 9-state auth machine with Origin-frame navigation;
//                  Closed is a first-class member of ITS variant.
//   • permission — m.d.pending_permission is DOMAIN state: the stream
//                  reducer raises it mid-turn, potentially while an
//                  overlay is open. Both must coexist; the router just
//                  hands permission the keyboard.
//   • todo       — an AMBIENT pane, not a modal: it stays open UNDER a
//                  picker and unclaimed keys fall through to global. Its
//                  open flag stays on TodoState.
// panel::top() (overlay.hpp) composes these four sources — login,
// permission, this slot, todo — into the one priority answer, which is
// now four checks instead of twenty.
//
// Each alternative INHERITS its overlay's existing Open payload
// (pick::OpenAt, palette::Open, …): same fields, same invariants, same
// manipulation code — plus a distinct TYPE so the slot can tell overlays
// apart and call sites name them directly.
//
// Pointer lifetime: get<K>() points INTO the slot. Assigning the slot
// destroys the previous alternative — capture what you need BEFORE
// opening a different overlay. (This was equally true with separate
// fields: assigning pick::Closed{} destroyed the payload too.)

// ── The three moves ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Navigation is a STACK, and there are exactly three things you can do to
// it. They differ ONLY in what happens to the parent chain, which is
// precisely the part a call site kept getting wrong:
//
//   descend(k)  DOWN.     k.from snapshots what is open. Esc unwinds to it.
//                         For an Open* handler: "open k over here".
//   replace(k)  SIDEWAYS. k INHERITS the current panel's parent. For a hop
//                         between siblings (^P from the model picker to the
//                         provider picker) — the panel you leave is gone,
//                         but where you CAME FROM is unchanged.
//   restore(k)  UP.       k is put back verbatim, chain included. For
//                         ascend(), and for rebuilding the panel you are
//                         already inside.
//
// Every one of these has been a bug at least once, always the same shape:
// a call site that meant one and spelled another, with no type to stop it.
//
//   • `operator=` was a fourth, unnamed move that DROPPED the chain. It
//     was documented as "use descend at OPEN sites" — a comment, so it was
//     not enforced: 13 Open* reducers assigned and 8 descended. palette →
//     providers → Esc left the stack entirely. It is now DELETED.
//   • The sideways hop was spelled `close<Old>(); descend(New);`, which
//     reads like "swap panels" and means "drop the grandparent": close()
//     leaves None, so descend() finds nothing to stash. palette → models →
//     ^P → Esc exited instead of returning to the palette. That is what
//     replace() exists to say.
//
// So the rule is: if you are changing what is in the slot, you must name
// which of the three you mean. There is no unnamed way left.
