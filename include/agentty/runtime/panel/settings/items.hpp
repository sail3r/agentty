    // affordance instead of a health dot, because they have no health —
    // they lead somewhere.
    //
    // Contiguous because the arrow used to be a hand-listed switch, and
    // Appearance was left out of it: the row that opens the largest pane in
    // Settings was the only door without a handle, reading as a value row
    // that happened to do something on Enter. A range check cannot be
    // half-updated the way a case list can.
    OpenRag,       // General: open the RAG mode picker
    OpenAppearance,// General: open the Appearance pane (theme, density, motion)
    OpenSmart,     // General: open Smart Mode config
    OpenSandbox,   // General: open the Sandbox pane (walls, syscalls, limits)
    OpenWebSearch, // General: open Web Search (web_search policy)

    ToggleChangesStrip, // General: show/hide the persistent "N changes" banner
    // (No RemovePlugin: removal is the two-step `d` → SettingsListRemove
    // flow, never an Enter action — a one-press destructive Enter and a
    // two-step d coexisting was a trap. See the reducer's Activate arm.)
    TogglePlugin,  // Plugins: enable/disable the WHOLE server (Enter, reversible)
    ToggleTool,    // Plugins: enable/disable one tool (arg=server, arg2=bare)

    ApproveHooks,  // Hooks: approve the active hooks file

    // ── Appearance ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
    //
    // One action per knob rather than a single CycleUiField(index): the
    // reducer then switches on a name instead of a number, so reordering
    // the rows cannot silently repoint a row at another setting.
    //
    // Appearance is NOT here. It was briefly a set of cyclic rows in this
    // list — Enter to step an enum, eleven of them in a flat wall — and it
    // was the wrong shape twice over: cycling four times to SEE the options
    // is worse than a list of them, and eleven ungrouped toggles have no
    // shape to read. It is a form pane now (panel/appearance.hpp), which is
    // where grouping, per-row help and provenance already live.

// Does activating this row OPEN ANOTHER PANE?
//
// One question, asked instead of a list maintained. The settings list uses
// it to paint the → affordance; anything else that needs to distinguish a
// door from a value can ask the same way rather than restating the set.
//
// A range over the contiguous block above, so adding a door between the
// brackets picks up the arrow with no second edit — which is exactly what
// went wrong before: Appearance was added to the enum, wired to a reducer,
// given a row, and left out of the one switch that paints the handle.
