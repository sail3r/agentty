// ── Salvaged-call re-leak dedup ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// Weak local models on the OpenAI-compat path (qwen2.5-coder:7b via Ollama,
// llama.cpp templates) leak tool calls as bare JSON in the `content` channel
// instead of the structured tool_calls[] channel. The transport salvages those
// into real tool calls with a synthetic `call_salvaged_N` id (see
// provider/openai/transport.cpp). But these models routinely RE-LEAK the same
// call on the post-tool sub-turn: they see the tool_result, then emit the
// identical {"name":...,"arguments":...} again. Without a guard that re-leaked
// call runs a SECOND time (the duplicate stuck card the user reported, e.g. a
// `remember` that ran DONE then a clone stuck RUNNING).
//
// A structured tool call is the model's deliberate intent (calling `read`
// twice with the same path is legitimate), so we ONLY dedup SALVAGED calls —
// identified by the `call_salvaged_` id prefix, which no real server ever
// mints. The scope is the current agent turn: the run of consecutive Assistant
// messages since the last User message. If a pending salvaged call is
// byte-identical (same name + same args) to a tool call already TERMINAL in
// that run, it's a re-leak — we resolve it as Failed-without-side-effects
// (never re-execute) so the wire-layer tool_use ↔ tool_result pairing stays
// valid while the side effect happens exactly once.

// We refine it the same way mcp-cpp's cap::scheduler does: track the SET OF
// PATHS each running/promoted tool touches, and let a writer (or reader)
// proceed concurrently when its paths don't OVERLAP any active path. A tool
// whose target path can't be extracted, or any Exec (bash — unbounded blast
// radius), keeps the conservative exclusive behaviour.

// Pull the fs target(s) out of a tool call's args, mirroring the built-in
// tool vocabulary (read/write/edit/find_definition use path|file_path;
// grep/glob/list_dir scope under an optional dir). Paths are resolved against
// the workspace and weakly canonicalised so lexical aliases (./, .., and
// absolute-vs-workspace-relative spellings) compare identically. nullopt means
